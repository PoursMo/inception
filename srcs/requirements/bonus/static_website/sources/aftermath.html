            The battle created the Saint-Mihiel salient projecting into the French lines south of Verdun. Of the two
            roads and one railway that led to Verdun, only a minor road remained open, which imposed severe supply
            difficulties on the French troops in the RFV. The city was enveloped on three sides and neutralised as a
            base for French offensive operations. The area would see much fighting over the rest of the war. Despite
            attempts by the French to reduce the salient in the First Battle of WoÃ«vre in early 1915, the First
            Offensive Battle of Verdun in late 1916 and the Second Offensive Battle of Verdun in 1917, the salient was
            not reduced until the Battle of Saint-Mihiel in September 1918.
