            The attack commenced on 19 September, with German cavalry from Metz skirmishing with the French defenders in
            the Dieulouardâ€“Martincourt area. Flirey, the woods around the village and the village of Seicheprey were
            quickly captured. French reinforcements arrived on 22 September but could not stop the Germans from
            advancing. The German advance then changed direction by moving from southerly to south-westerly. By 24
            September, the town of Saint-Mihiel was captured and villages of Flirey, Seicheprey and Xivray recaptured.
            More French reinforcements arrived on 27 September but as the Germans were now firmly entrenched, French
            counter-attacks between Flirey and Apremont resulted in little change in the front line and continued until
            11 October.
