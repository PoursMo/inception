            The Woëvre Plain stretches from the city of Luxemburg, south to the French city of Toul and has been a
            common route of attack between Germany and France. The plain is flanked on the western side by a series of
            mountain ranges (the Hauts de Meuse) along the Meuse River and along the eastern side by a series of
            mountain ranges along the Moselle River. A series of German fortifications was built before the war along
            the Moselle (especially around the city of Metz), and across the border, a matching set of French
            fortifications was established along the Meuse around Verdun and Toul.<br><br>

            In the first months of the war, Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, German High Command) first realised the
            increased effectiveness that artillery and machine guns gave to the defence and seized various terrain
            features that would be easy to defend. Recognising that it is easier to defend the heights along the Meuse
            than the plain between the Moselle and Meuse, a German attack was planned to seize the heights, deny access
            to the Woëvre Plain to the Allies, isolate Verdun and reduce the ability of the French to attack German
            territory.
